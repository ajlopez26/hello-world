## About Me
### Description
I'm Angela Lopez, a sophomore student at the University of Iowa, currently majoring in Business Analytics and Accounting. One of my notable skills is being bilingual in both English and Spanish, which allows me to communicate effectively and work with a diverse range of individuals. This *proficiency* in two languages not only enhances my ability to collaborate with people from different backgrounds but also presents valuable opportunities in the business analytics field where data insights often need to be interpreted and communicated to a wide audience. I am also a certified nursing assistat (CNA), which reflects my commitment to school work and helping others. This experience alongside my multiple customer service jobs have helped me develop my interpersonal skills, attention to detail, and ability to work under pressure â€“ all of which can be valuable assets in the business industry.
